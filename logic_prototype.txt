Data Ingestion:

Use Yahoo Finance API to fetch hourly data for each symbol.
Implement a scheduler to trigger data fetching at regular intervals (hourly).
Store the fetched data in a database. Considering the volume of data, a relational database like PostgreSQL or a time-series database like InfluxDB might be suitable.
Database Schema:

Design a schema to efficiently store the hourly data for each symbol. It should include fields such as symbol, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume, etc.
Optimize the database schema and indexing strategy for efficient querying and retrieval.
Data Processing:

Implement data cleaning and validation processes to handle missing or erroneous data.
Calculate any additional metrics required for technical analysis (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD).
Alerting System:

Develop a technical analysis module to analyze the stored data and generate alerts based on predefined conditions (e.g., moving average crossovers, overbought/oversold conditions).
Integrate a messaging service API (such as Twilio for WhatsApp) to send alerts as WhatsApp messages.
Implement a notification service that triggers alerts based on the results of the technical analysis module.
User Interface:

Develop a dashboarding interface to visualize the stored data and any generated alerts.
Allow users to customize their alert preferences and view historical data.
Scaling Considerations:

Design the system with scalability in mind, considering the potential increase in the number of symbols or data volume over time.
Use cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud Platform for scalability and reliability.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the health and performance of the system.
Set up alerts for system errors or failures.
Security:

Implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
Testing and Deployment:

Thoroughly test the system components, including data fetching, processing, alerting, and user interface.
Automate deployment processes to streamline updates and ensure reliability.
By following this system design, you can create a robust stockscreener capable of fetching, storing, analyzing, and alerting on hourly data for a large number of NSE symbols, with the capability to send alerts via WhatsApp based on technical analysis.








prompt 

i have a python script which can get the new data from yahoo api from the date range between last run and current time. i am storing the last run time in config.json file and reading in the python file. i want to scedule this code using airlfow. could you help me how to do this. and is airflow suitable for this or any other service will work. actually this is my data engineer project. i can give you more context if you want. i want you help to build this project
